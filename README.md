# Scheduler

A scheduling web application that allows users to create an event on a particular date and assign attendees to that event. When assigning an attendee, the user has the option to set the attendees transportation mode and current status. An attendees status may be set to either Attending, not attending, maybe, and unknown. The scheduling web application allows users to see events planned for any date and prohibits the creation of events on overlapping dates.
